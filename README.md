## About this repository

The original project from this repo comes from Build-Week-TT24FT-VR-FUNDING
/
front-end, which was a week-long build week project (Jan 4 - 9th) assigned by Lambda School. I was the senior front-end developer for the project, and was in charge of all private routing, CRUD operations, state management, etc. All work which was not mine has been nearly completely redone to prevent this project from being misleading. All work on the back-end, however, is not mine. Proper credit for the back-end can be found in "Build-Week-TT24FT-VR-FUNDING
/
back-end"

Throughout this project, you will see modern styling and an app with various features, including (but not limited to):

- CRUD Operations
- Private Routing/authentication/authorization
- Form validation
- Redux w/ middleware (thunk, logger, devtools)

Majority of this app is centered around the 'fundraiser' role, so if you are to test the app out, i recommend you create a 'fundraiser' account rather than a 'funder' account.  Thank you for visiting!
