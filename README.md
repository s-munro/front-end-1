## About this repository

The original project from this repo comes from Build-Week-TT24FT-VR-FUNDING
/
front-end, which was a week-long build week project (Jan 4 - 9th) assigned by Lambda School. I was the senior front-end developer for the project, and was in charge of all private routing, CRUD operations, state management, etc. All work which was not mine has been nearly completely redone to prevent this project from being misleading. All work on the back-end, however, is not mine. Proper credit for the back-end can be found in "Build-Week-TT24FT-VR-FUNDING
/
back-end"

Throughout this project, you will see basic modern styling with various features such as:

- CRUD Operations
- Private Routing/authentication/authorization
- Form validation
- Redux w/ middleware (thunk, logger, devtools)
